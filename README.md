# Kanban Project

This project is a **Kanban board** developed using **pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, without any external frameworks.

The goal is to build a **lightweight and modular application** that allows you to:

- Create, edit, and delete boards.
- Create, edit, and delete cards within each board.
- Mark cards as completed.
- Assign and display priorities with different colors and styles.

The application is **powered by a backend** already deployed at:

The source code of the backend can be found here:
